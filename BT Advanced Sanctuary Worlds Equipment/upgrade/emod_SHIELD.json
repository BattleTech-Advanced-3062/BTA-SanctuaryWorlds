A series of interlocking plates inside of a SHIELDed location combined with a rear vent out of the location allows for containment and channeling of any internal explosions in that location. Given the Sacellum's use of explosive chemical coolants, the SHIELD system has saved many mechs from total destruction. However, some amount of damage is still done to the internals (ten points worth) despite the SHIELD.",
