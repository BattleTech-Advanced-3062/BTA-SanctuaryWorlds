The Sacellum is located in a cloud between Star Cluster 65 and Star Cluster Briceno 1

The Sacellum consists of about 10 core systems, each with multiple inhabited worlds, and a series of outlying systems in a rough ring around the core worlds that serve as shields and resource sources for the core Sacellum worlds. 

There are also a handful of outlying outpost worlds towards the IS that are used to stage the invasion of the Taurian Concordat. The lower right quarter of the Concordat has been invaded by the Sacellum and they exist on those worlds as targets and employers. The Taurians have in turn attacked the Sacellum's shield worlds and are target/employer there as well.
