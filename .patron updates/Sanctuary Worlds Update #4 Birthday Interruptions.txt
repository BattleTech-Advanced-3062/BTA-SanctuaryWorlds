Sanctuary Worlds Update #4: Birthday Interruptions

Since last update, BD has been very very busy! Sadly, a whole week of it wasn't with the new project. For those unaware, October 6th was my birthday. That week was mostly consumed by preparations for my birthday stream, as well some IRL stuff involving paperwork that took an obscenely long time to chew through, so the week of October 3-9 was pretty well a wash.

This week, I've managed to get back on the horse of making content for the Sanctuary Worlds. However, I've hit the slower part of unit creation where I'm making entirely new chassis for them that have no Inner Sphere analogues, which reduces me to about a chassis per day. This week I've made the following four chassis (with a fifth on the way today, Friday, but not ready yet): the Lithobolos, the Cheetah, the Taranis, and the Rashnu. I have roughly another 10 or so to do and then I think I'll mostly be done with mechs for them for the time being. They won't have quite as many chassis as I might like, but I'm limited somewhat by available models. 

After the mechs, which will hopefully be mostly done by next Patreon update, I'll turn my eye to tanks and turrets. After that, it's planets and events and we'll be approaching a release. In there somewhere will be a specialized patron-only demo of course, so keep an eye out for that!

That's all I got today folks, come back in a few weeks for the next update!
