Sanctuary Worlds Update #2: How's It Going, BD?

So it's been a pretty fruitful two weeks for the new project but it'll be super quick to explain it. 

I've spent the last two weeks just starting to make mechs. I've had a few interruptions for core BTA (such as making the Iron Cheetah and Hammerhead mechs, as well as another one to be revealed on Monday's stream [it's a Clan mech and it's very goofy]) and I did take one day off this week to just hang out with friends mid-day, so progress hasn't been AS good as desired but it's still alright. In the last two weeks I've made the following mechs for the Sanctuary Worlds: 

-Wasp II (25 tons, new model)
-Stinger II (25 tons, new model)

-Locust II (25 tons, new model)

-Catapult

-Shadow Hawk II (same model, same tonnage)

-Warhammer

-Longbow

-Firestarter

-Dervish

-Thunderbolt

-Rifleman

-Hunchback II (same model, same tonnage)



I've also made a few new pieces of gear for them, including the Twin-Linked Laser (a 1 ton, 1 crit energy weapon that's basically two small lasers duct-taped together), the Sanctuary Supercharger (which boosts run speed but takes crits in the legs and CT), and Modular Plating Mk 1 thru Mk 4 (adds extra armor, weighs between 0.25 tons and 1 ton). This gear is starting to get slotted into mechs and will be present in their forces.


And that's the report! Not much to say this report but this is what it looks like day-to-day, just makin' stuff and chuggin' away at the project. Hopefully can get further into the mechs over the next two weeks.


Thanks for being here with me folks while I work on the Sanctuary Worlds! Pretty excited about it!
