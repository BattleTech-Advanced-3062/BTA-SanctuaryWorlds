Sanctuary Worlds Update #3 It's Still Goin'

Just like two weeks ago, I've basically just been making mechs. Wish I had something more interesting to say, but it's gonna be "BD makes boring stuff" for quite awhile. I've just about finished their "canon" chassis, that is to say the mechs that the Sanctuary Worlds took with them out of the Inner Sphere when they left in 2571. Now I have to start the slower and longer process of making their custom chassis using models that don't exist in BTA just yet. This means making new quirks, new affinities, etc. Exciting!

The current roster of stuff I've made in the last two weeks includes:

-Thorn

-Wolverine

-Guillotine

-Orion

-Victor

-Archer

-Pixie (this is a Phoenix Hawk fork using the Phoenix Hawk Legacy model)

-Trooper (this is based on the OG Flea)

-Commando

-Scorpion

-Griffin

-Ostroc

-Ostwar

-Helepolis

-Emperor

All that's left for the "canon" chassis is their remaining assaults, the Banshee and Mackie. I hope to have those done sooner than later. After that, I have approximately 10-12 custom chassis that need made. I do worry that this won't be enough unit variety, but that's a Future BD issue to deal with, frankly.


After *that*, I can start on things like the tanks, turrets, and then the non-gear/unit stuff like their planets and start planning out the event chains and such. No idea what the timeline on that stuff is gonna be like to be honest. My general rough goal is to get the mechs done in October and get a tech demo out to higher-tier patrons by end of October. This will not contain any factions or anything, just the gear and mechs and a demo save that contains it all that you can load to play around with the stuff and give some feedback.


My really long-term goal to hit is Christmas for Sanctuary Worlds release. I think that's realistic but we'll see what I can do. When I said this was gonna be a longer-term project, I weren't kiddin', yo.


Anyway, that's the update for today. Keep on keepin' on, folks, and thanks for being with me on the journey!
