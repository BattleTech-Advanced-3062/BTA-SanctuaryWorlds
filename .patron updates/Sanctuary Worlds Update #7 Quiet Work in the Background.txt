Sanctuary Worlds Update #7: Quiet Work in the Background

The past two weeks have been relatively quiet on the homefront as I've dealt with some IRL stuff, but there's been forward progress on the Sanctuary Worlds. On Oct 31st, I released the Patron-only tech preview and have been coallating feedback on Discord and making balance adjustments as we go. It's been an absolutely great process and I love the feedback. If you've not had a chance to check out the preview yet, get on it, I'd love your feedback and balance suggestions! :D

Meanwhile, I've also been making the actual planets themselves for the Sanctuary Worlds. I've finished their space completely. The final planet count is 34 inhabited worlds and 11 new jump points to get around with. Of the four new factions, three have 8 planets each and one has 10. I'll post a picture of the new worlds as a separate post so you can see where they're situated. As for how you'll actually get there, their worlds will be hidden from view at first and will be unlocked via new in-game timeline events that will also help tell the story of the Sanctuary's invasion of the Inner Sphere. As the timeline progresses through 3062-3064, their worlds will be unlocked and appear on the map dynamically. I'll have more information about this as I get into the actual "making the events" aspect of things.

That's about what I got for ya today. Keep an eye on this space for further Timeline of the Sanctuary Worlds posts so you can get more of their history as I'll be posting more of that very soon!
